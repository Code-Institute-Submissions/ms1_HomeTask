# Milestone 1 Project: HomeTask


This is a project to mark the completion of User Centric Frontend Development part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development diploma. For this project I have developed a website for a fictional service company offering home task related services such as grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, ironing, gardening and dog walking.


This website enables customers to see the services offered by the company and to be able to request for a service.
 
## UX
 
This website is targeted at customers. It showcases the services being offered by the company. Customers will be able to see the services being offered by the company, they will see the pricing, and they will be able to contact the company for a quotation. 

## User stories

### As a user, customers will be able to:

* See services provided by the company
* See prices for each service
* Request for a quotation
* Contact the company
* Read about the company

## Wireframes
My initial plan was a paper based sketch however, I made use of Balsamiq for the final mock-ups.

Bootstrap was used for responsiveness and a quick way of implementing sections such as the navbar, pricing and services pages.


### 4. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

Gitpod was used as the code editor for creating the website.

### 5. [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)

GitHub was used for publishing of the website.

### 7. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### 11. [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#)

Am I Responsive web application was used to test for responsiveness in different screen sizes.


## Testing

1. I carried out responsiveness testing using Chrome DevTools as I was building the website, I also used the Am I responsive web application to test the responsiveness:

![Responsive](assets/images/wireframe/Responsive.pgn)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)

2. I tested all the web pages myself on the following browsers using Iphone 6 plus:
* Safari
* Chrome

3. I also tested the web pages on the following brosers using a Macbookpro:
* Safari
* Chrome

4. I got my girlfriend to test the webpages using her Iphone 7 and Iphone XR

5. For code validation, I used the following:
* W3C HTML Validator - To validate my HTML codes
* W3C CSS Validator - To validate my CSS codes

### Test Results

During the testing on a physical mobile phone, I found that the home page hero image renders differently compared to the way it renders on DevTools. I fixed this by making use of a different image which rendered as expected. 


## Deployment

For deployment of this project I made use of GitHub by taking the following steps:

1. From my repositories in GitHub, I selected the project and clicked on settings
2. Under the GitHub Pages Section of the settings, I selected master branch as the source
3. On refresh of the page, the published url of the project appeared under GitHub Pages section of the settings.

To clone the project locally on your computer, follow the following steps:

1. Open the GitHub repository [HomeTask](https://github.com/Tchucks/ms1_HomeTask)

2. Click the dropdown on the Code button (green in color) and copy the project URL

3. From IDE of your choice, open Git Bash and type in git clone

4. Paste the project URL and press enter.
